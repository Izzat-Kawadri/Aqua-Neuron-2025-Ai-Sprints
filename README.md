## 🕰 Journey Through the Seasons  

### 🔙 Season 1 (2023) – Codeforces 
- The first Aqua Neuron challenge centered on solving **Codeforces problems**.  
- I solved one problem with **a single prompt** in ChatGPT **3.5**, an exciting personal milestone.  
- Back then, *prompt engineering* was a brand-new trend, and I was still discovering what this mysterious “black box” AI was all about.  

### 🚀 Growth Since Then  
- Completed multiple **AI training sessions** in machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI.  
- Explored how AI enhances:  
  - 📊 **Scientific research**  
  - 💻 **Programming & development**  
  - ✍ **Content creation**  
  - 🎥 **Media production**
